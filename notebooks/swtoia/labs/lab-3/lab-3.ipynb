    "\n",
    "NVIDIA provides a layer on top of the CUDA platform called CUDA-X , which is a collection of libraries, tools, and technologies. \n",
    "\n",
    "GPU-accelerated CUDA libraries enable drop-in acceleration across multiple domains such as linear algebra, image and video processing, deep learning, and graph analytics.\n",
    "\n",
    "NVIDIA CUDA toolkit provides a collection of libaries:\n",
    "* Math libaries: cuBLAS, cuRAND, cuFFT\n",
    "* Parallel Algorithm libraries: nvGRAPH, Thrust\n",
    "* Image and video libraries: nvJPEG, NPP\n",
    "* Communication libraries: NVSHMEM, NCCL\n",
    "* Deep Learning libraries: cuDNN, TensorRT, Riva\n",
    "\n",
    "### **CUDA API Migration Support Status and oneAPI API-Based Programming**\n",
    "\n",
    "CUDA API migration support can be found in https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/docs/dpcpp-compatibility-tool/developer-guide-reference/2023-2/cuda-api-migration-support-status.html \n",
    "\n",
    "Before starting out a migration, it is important to learn about the software libraries dependency of the CUDA program. If a CUDA program uses higher level CUDA-based library or using CUDA Graphs technologies that coordinate large number of GPU operations, SYCLomatic tool would not be able to do the job as it is designed to take care of foundational CUDA libaries migration.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is also the reason, oneAPI offers two software programming modes:\n",
    "* **Direct Programming** - at SYCL C++ level.\n",
    "* **API-Based Programming**  - a collection of oneAPI libraries that are comparable to the set of CUDA foundational libraries.\n",
    "\n",
    "![oneAPI Programming Modes](./images/oneAPI-libraries.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Brief Summary**\n",
    "* Converting CUDA program that uses foundational libraries can be accelerated by SYCLomatic tool\n",
    "* If CUDA program uses high level CUDA-based libraries, use oneAPI API-Based libraries as they would yield faster migration.\n",
    "  If your program requires specialized device/kernel code, write them in SYCL C++ directly."
